I have access to a python code repository in the directory /testbed. You can explore and modify files using the available tools. Consider the following issue description:

<issue_description>
Methods decorated with @classmethod and @property do not get documented.
**EDIT:** The problem seems to be that `type(BaseClass.baseclass_property)` returns `property`, thus sphinx can just lookup `BaseClass.baseclass_property.__doc__`. However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.

**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682. 

> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute. 

I will try to test this with the beta release.

### Describe the bug

> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().

That is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like

```python
class A:
    @classmethod
    @property
    def f(cls):
        """Some class property."""
        return "property"
```

However, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)

### How to Reproduce


```bash
git clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo
cd sphinx_demo/docs
make html
# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html
```

The following methods were erroneously not documented:

- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`
- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`
- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`
- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`
- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`
- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`


### Expected behavior

Methods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.

</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any test files described in the <issue_description>. Do not modify test files. You may inspect and run tests, but all code changes must be limited to non-test implementation files.
Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.
Prefer the smallest implementation change that satisfies the issue without changing unrelated behavior.
Use /testbed as the editable repository throughout the task.
Each shell command runs in a fresh shell. If a command needs the test environment, activate it in that same command, for example:
source /opt/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate testbed && python -m pytest ...
Do not modify tests, test fixtures, generated expected outputs, or benchmark metadata.

Use the following workflow as a guide:

Phase 1. READING: understand the issue
   1.1 Identify key files, APIs, error messages, expected behavior, and reproduction details.
   1.2 Keep notes concise and focused on facts needed for the fix.
   1.3 Identify explicit questions, ambiguity, unresolved constraints, and tradeoffs in the issue description. Treat them as parts of the task to reason about, not optional commentary.

Phase 2. RUNNING: run relevant tests on the repository
   2.1 Use self-contained shell commands that activate the environment and then run the test or reproduction command.
   2.2 Run focused tests or commands related to the issue.
   2.3 Do not install packages or change environment/setup files.
   2.4 Iterate only on commands that provide useful evidence for the fix.

Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
   3.3 Select the most likely implementation location and avoid unrelated refactors.

Phase 4. TEST CREATION: if useful, create a small temporary script to reproduce and verify the issue.
   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
   4.2 Prefer existing focused tests when they already cover the issue.
   4.3 If no focused test is available, create a minimal temporary reproduction script.
   4.4 Remove temporary scratch scripts before finishing.

Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: choose a focused fix
   5.1 State the concrete cause and the implementation change needed.
   5.2 Avoid broad behavior changes unless the issue requires them.

Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.

Phase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
   7.1 Run focused verification to confirm the fix works.
   7.2 Check relevant edge cases.
   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.
   7.4 If a relevant existing test fails after your change, treat it as a likely regression unless you have concrete evidence it is unrelated.

Phase 8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 939c7bb7ff7c53a4d27df067cea637540f0e1dad.
   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.
   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:
     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing
     8.2.2 The files you modified
     8.2.3 The functions you changed
   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass
   8.4 Before finishing, challenge your solution: name the most likely way it could still be incomplete or wrong based on the issue description, then run or write a focused check for that risk when practical.
   8.5 Inspect the final patch with `git diff -- .`.
   8.6 Do not leave temporary scripts, debug files, or scratch artifacts in the final patch.
   8.7 Keep only the minimal non-test source-code changes needed for the issue.

Be focused: gather enough evidence to make the correct minimal fix, then verify it with relevant tests.
